# Learning HTML and CSS
This repository showcases my learning process for HTML and CSS, as I worked through various tutorials and exercises to build my skills in web development. I learned the basics of HTML, including the writing conventions, the structure of the document, and how to create tables and forms.

In addition to HTML, I also learned CSS, which is used to style and format web pages. I learned how to use CSS to position elements on a page, add colors and backgrounds, and create custom shapes and designs using clip path. I also learned a bit of transforms.

# Sample Website
To practice my CSS skills, I created a sample website that includes my picture and information about the places where I learned HTML and CSS. The website showcases my ability to use CSS to create a visually appealing web page.
